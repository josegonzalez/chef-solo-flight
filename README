Chef Solo Flight

This is based off of http://github.com/threedaymonk/chef-ec2

If your current server setup does not require the use of Chef Server, Chef Solo is a great
alternative until you need to move up.  The ideal use case is when you only have a few
servers that you must maintain.

If you need a head start on some recipes, go ahead and grab the cookbooks submodule:
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update

To get started, perform the following steps:

1. Bring up a new instance/machine somewhere, a bare OS is perfect.

2. Generate an ssh key if you do not have one (accept defaults or assign a password):
  $ ssh-keygen

3. Get your ssh key onto the instance:
  $ cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh <server_name> "mkdir .ssh && cat - >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys && chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
  
4. Bootstrap Chef onto the instance:
  $ ./chef-solo-flight bootstrap <server_1> [<server_2>] ...

Now you must create some DNA for your servers.  Create new DNA.json files per server, please see the Chef
documentation here: http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Cooking+with+Chef

Once complete, you can then update your instances like so:
  $ ./chef-solo-flight update <server_1> [<server_2>] ...

You can run the above command as many times as you will like, the instance(s) will only be updated
if there were changes to your DNA.
